**Project Summary:**

• Analyzed the characteristics and valuation data of hundreds of startup founders using the Startup Founder Valuations Dataset from Kaggle, processed through BigQuery and Mode Analytics; conducted data cleaning in SQL and performed statistical analysis in Python to debunk common myths about founder backgrounds and their impact on startup success

**Dataset Details:**

• The “Startup Founder Valuations Dataset” is a Kaggle dataset that describes the characteristics of hundreds of startup founders, including their previous work experience, academic background, educational attainment, as well as their startup valuations across several rounds of funding
