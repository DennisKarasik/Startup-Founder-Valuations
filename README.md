**Project Overview:**

• The “Startup Founder Valuations Dataset” is a Kaggle dataset that describes the characteristics of hundreds of startup founders, including their previous work experience, academic background, educational attainment, as well as their startup valuations across several rounds of funding.

• The dataset was initially put together by an organization called FirmAI, which is a centralized repository of academic research and public data.

• This dataset contains two CSV files titled `startup_founder_chars` and `startup_valuations`.

**Data Processing:**

• Data downloaded from Kaggle, uploaded into BigQuery as two tables, then connected to Mode Analytics

• Data cleaning and analysis performed in SQL, charts and dashboard built using Report Builder in Mode, and statistical tests performed in Python
